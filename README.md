# Candlebright - Ominous Whip
Candlebright was a game developed as college work.

Candlebright is a rogue-like game based on Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance and Dead Cells.
There are 2 phases, with some monster types as Zombies, Ghosts, and many others.
There are some obstacles so the game get more difficult as well.
